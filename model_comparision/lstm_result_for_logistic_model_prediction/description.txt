_1: the noise part is 0.05 * sqrt(t)
_2: the noise part is 1 * sqrt(t)
_3: the noise part is sqrt(t) generate 300 while NA is dropped so only 100 left, same number as before. for this one the model does not perform well even i tried with different lr and epoch.

#    learning_rate = 0.05 #
    num_epochs = 200
